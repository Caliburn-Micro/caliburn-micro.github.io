title: Caliburn.Micro &middot; 'Xaml made easy'
---

A small, yet powerful framework, designed for building applications across all XAML platforms (.NET 4.6.2+ and .NET (core) 8.0+). Its strong support for MV* patterns will enable you to build your solution quickly, without the need to sacrifice code quality or testability.

### Works everywhere Xaml does
Supports WPF, UWP, Avalonia UI, WinUI3, .net Maui, and Xamarin.Forms apps.

#### and many more ...

## Get Started
The quickest way to get started is down grab the latest package from [Nuget][nuget] and browse the [documentation][docs]. If you're running into trouble checkout our [support][support] section.

## Features
---
#### Bind view model properties to your view based on convention


``` xml
<ListBox x:Name="Products" />
``` 

``` csharp
public BindableCollection<ProductViewModel> Products
{
    get; private set; 
}

public ProductViewModel SelectedProduct
{
    get { return _selectedProduct; }
    set
    {
        _selectedProduct = value;
        NotifyOfPropertyChange(() => SelectedProduct);
    }
}
```

>Even at design time!


#### Apply methods between your view and view model automatically with parameters and guard methods

``` xml
<StackPanel>
    <TextBox x:Name="Username" />
    <PasswordBox x:Name="Password" />
    <Button x:Name="Login" Content="Log in" />
</StackPanel>
```

``` csharp
public bool CanLogin(string username, string password)
{
    return !String.IsNullOrEmpty(username) && !String.IsNullOrEmpty(password);
}

public string Login(string username, string password)
{
    ...
}
```


#### Decouple view models with built in composition patterns and event aggregation 
``` csharp
public class DocumentTabsViewModel : Conductor<TabViewModel>.Collection.OneActive
{
	...
}
```

``` csharp
public class CartSummaryViewModel : IHandle<CartChangedMessage>
{
	...
}
```
