title: Roadmap
---

Below is a rough roadmap for the future direction of Caliburn.Micro. This will be a living document that is routinely updated as time and priorities change.

The list has been broken down into sections, some of which can be done in parallel and some sequentially. Each will have a rough overview of what's covered and any development notes around approach.


## 5.0.0

`5.0.0` will include support for .net Maui, .net 6, WinUI, and AvaloniaUI



## Website and documentation overhaul

A lot of the documentation was written by Rob quite a while ago as a series of blog posts with new pages added as other platforms came onboard. It badly needs a restructure to be more consistent.
