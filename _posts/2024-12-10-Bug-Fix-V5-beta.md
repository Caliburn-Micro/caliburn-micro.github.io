### Bug fix for Caliburn.Micro V4

This address an issue with the screen Activation/Deactivation logic.  ([Bug 906](https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro/issues/906))

Due to issues with the build we had to update the android version to 11

## I would like to thank @darxis and @Yinimi for there hard work.

### Caliburn Micro V5 beta

In this version we add support for .net Maui, Avalonia UI, and WinUi 3

We are dropping support for some expired .net (core) versions.  The versions of .net support are .net 8.0 and 9.0.  .net Framework version 4.62 and later are supported.

We add CodeQL scans to our work load so we have fixes for issues found with the scans.

Added GitHub packages as a location you can get the latest version of our packages from.

Xamarin Forms was updated to V5. (note this is will be the last version that includes Xamarin)

Added unit tests for additonal platforms

I would like to thank @KasperSK, @K4PS3, @ravibaghel, @Dennis40816, @darxis, @Yinimi, @Stannieman, @danwalmsley for your hard work.

### Caliburn Micros future

Created Caliburn.Micro Extensions project.  This project will contain templates for caliburn micro.  We will also include a code generator to make INotifyPropertyChanged easier.  We will also include some additional IValue converters.  

Will add support for the Uno Platform in V6

Performance Improvements for Caliburn.Micro
